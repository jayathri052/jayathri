# 🧑‍💻 Beginner-Level Programs

Welcome! 👋

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level programs that I created a few years ago when I was starting my coding journey. These small projects and scripts helped me understand the basics of programming, logic building, and syntax.

## 🛠️ What's Inside

- Basic programs (loops, conditionals, arrays)
- Simple logic-building exercises
- Introductory projects in different languages (e.g., C, C++, Python, Java)
- Console-based applications
- Mini games or pattern programs

> These programs reflect my early learning stages and are intended for educational and reference purposes.

## 💡 Purpose

- Practice basic syntax and logic
- Strengthen problem-solving skills
- Serve as a resource for beginners starting out in programming
